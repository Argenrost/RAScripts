Likely will change Revision Proposal 

Win each of the levels for Original Game at 4 CPU (GAME not round)  Probably 3-5 points. They're easier than expected (the AI is Fing dumb)

Will require Level 9 AI. But still the AI is dumb. 

Puzzles divided up into 6.  Need to figure out scores. 

Beat the time.  Low score but also divided into 6. 

Snake will get 100, 200 and 250.   Could go higher. 


Puzzles
There are 96 stages in the full version. They will be broken up into sets of 6 to give players a decent amount of feedback.
Values will probably be low, 1-3 points for the first four sets of puzzles (first 24). I still need to play the other 72 to get a feel for difficulty, but a few of the "Mania" are auto play.

The puzzles will be broken up a second time to require beating each stage's time limit.

If I find stages that can be won with out using all the tiles, special achievements will be listed for them (I have seen at least 1)

Cats Soccer will not be covered (it's 4 player multiplayer only, no CPUs.)

Snake will be tested and appropriate scores will be generated.

The actual game was made for the Sega CD, and has a bit more content than the Mega Drive Demo. Demo doesn't appear to have special content.
