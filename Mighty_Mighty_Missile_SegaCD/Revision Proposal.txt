Revision proposal

Current achievements are Voided.
Change hash/game to Mighty Mighty Missile Sega CD (This is just the demo) Target: c3f476595c1151bde8b87e7a8e2c5c30

The Original game will get a couple achievements.
Win the game vs 1 CPU (2-3 points)
Win the game vs 3 CPU (5-10 points)

Puzzles
There are 96 stages in the full version. They will be broken up into sets of 6 to give players a decent amount of feedback.
Values will probably be low, 1-3 points for the first four sets of puzzles (first 24). I still need to play the other 72 to get a feel for difficulty, but a few of the "Mania" are auto play.

The puzzles will be broken up a second time to require beating each stage's time limit.

If I find stages that can be won with out using all the tiles, special achievements will be listed for them (I have seen at least 1)

Cats Soccer will not be covered (it's 4 player multiplayer only, no CPUs.)

Snake will be tested and appropriate scores will be generated.

The actual game was made for the Sega CD, and has a bit more content than the Mega Drive Demo. Demo doesn't appear to have special content.
