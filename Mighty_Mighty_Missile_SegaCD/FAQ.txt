[b]Why this game? [/b]

It's number 5 in the database.   

[b]Really?[/b]

Yup, that's literally the only reason.   No love for Chu Chu Rocket, nothing particularly impressive about this game.  But I saw an opportunity to get a low number ID, and I'm taking it. 

[b]Wasn't this a Mega Drive game? [/b]

The Demo was for the Mega Drive, the full release was the Sega CD.  Thanks to the Admins for changing the system, that's a big ask I know. 

[b]What was the original achievements for this? [/b]

1000 mouse saved, 4000 saved, beat the puzzles.  Kind of weak, but the Demo was limited as is. 

[b]The timer based achievements deserve more points[/b]

Considering you solve the achievement and then resolve them as fast as possible, I almost didn't put any points on it, but you know what, have some freebees.

[b]I can't solve X puzzle for the bonus[/b]  

One of them requires a bit of a glitch (The mouse walks through the cat) but all of them are doable. 

[b]Why is there a snake game?[/b]

I know right?
