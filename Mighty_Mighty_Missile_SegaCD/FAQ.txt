[b]Why this game? [/b]

It's number 5 in the database.   

[b]Really?[/b]

Yup, that's literally the only reason.   No love for Chu Chu Rocket, nothing particularly impressive about this game.  But I saw an opportunity to get a low number ID, and I'm taking it. 

[b]Wasn't this a Mega Drive game? [/b]

The Demo was for the Mega Drive, the full release was the Sega CD.  Thanks to the Admins for changing the system, that's a big ask I know. 

[b]What was the original achievements for this? [/b]

1000 mouse saved, 4000 saved, beat the puzzles.  Kind of weak, but the Demo was limited as is. 

[b]The timer based achievements deserve more points[/b]

Considering you solve the achievement and then resolve them as fast as possible, I almost didn't put any points on it, but you know what, have some freebees.

[b]I can't solve X puzzle for the bonus[/b]  

One of them requires a bit of a glitch (The mouse walks through the cat) but all of them are doable. 

[b]Why is there a snake game?[/b]

I know right? 

[b]What are the controls?[/b]

Oh right, I've played this so much they're second nature to me. 

When in a level Press A to run the simulation/game.   Press A+ B to reset the game to planning mode (which wipes the arrows) .  

While in planning mode hit B and a direction to  place an arrow on the square you're on in the direction you press (if you have one in stock).  tap B to remove the arrow (This only works like... 33 percent of the time, maybe it's speed dependent). 

There is a way to speed up the simulation, but I'll leave that for you to find.

To leave a level press Start, and then press A+B+C
