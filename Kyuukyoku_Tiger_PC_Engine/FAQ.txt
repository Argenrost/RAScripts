[b]Why this set? [/b]

One of the most requested games for the system was a big part.  DevJam helped, but honestly... it's a damn good game. 

[b]So how's the set?[/b]

This is what I might call a "Progression set"... though it's not.   

Beat each level
Beat each level with out a death. 
Beat each level collecting all the stars
Score achievements. (I was able to hit 2 million on my first loop, so that's VERY doable, but very hard.) 

... and then because I wanted to find something different... stay alive for 60 seconds at each boss.  

[b]Is that possible?[/b]

So that's the thing.  I was able to do it, with a few assists, I'm assuming I'm "Old fogey" reaction times, so I hope someone can with out cheating.

[b]Stage 10 boss is impossible[/b]

So for stage 5 and stage 10 you can destroy the gun turrets.  However I was considering tossing 25 on it, but while testing it I found a spot where the enemy can't hit you and you don't have to move.  Probably not easy to move to, but ... definitely not worth 10, sorry.   Others... well good luck. 

[b]Can I just keep going to rack up the score?  Why leaderboard every stage? [/b]

A. Why not?  That way if you just turn off the game you're on the board.  Yay!  

B. Actually no there's a pretty bad bug.  If you do two loops, the game ends.  But wait, that bug persists so you can only do two loops on a fresh boot.   I believe after the first loop the game "breaks" and will give you only a single loop. 

Basically if going for high score runs, or two loops, reset the game before each run.  

[b]Any other thoughts on the game[/b]

Ok I've sat and worked on this game for multiple hours.  Is it just me or does the music sounds like "Time After Time" by Cyndi Lauper some times? ...  I'm probably losing it. 

Also that Yellow gun is just terrible, I have not called out the cheat for homing weapons, but I think it's worth using for some achievements. 

It takes over 2 full levels with out dying to get max power.  You can just switch weapons after you hit max power, but yeah, it's a hard feat. 

The two free lives cheat is allowed (That's me being nice).  The addition credit cheat is not, it'll lock ALL achievements and leaderboard until you go back to the main menu and return to the game. 

There's a hidden Credits, there's an achievement, support the devs, especially when they have to sneak their names in the game. 

Overall this should be a fun set, but I will admit it's going to be brutally hard.  Good luck, you're going to need it.
