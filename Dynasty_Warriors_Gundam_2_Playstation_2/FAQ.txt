[b]Why this game?[/b]

IT'S GUNDAM! GUNDAM IS LIFE! 

I never made a model kit, this game made me buy one after I claimed it, and then buy many many more.   Every suit is awesome, Read Mobile Suit Gundam: Origin.  Learn about the rich history.  This is THE Mecha franchise! LOVE THE GUNDAM!

Also apparently it's a musou game. 

[b]Well that happened but why?[/b] 

383 mission, 40 playable characters, 40 playable stories, 66 different suits, each controls differently (mostly), Just tons of content.

The rich history means you have 5 mission arcs for most of the 40 characters, you have the original story for four characters, covering three series (and an OVA).   

There's just a lot of good in here.  Plus it's fun to play, tons of stuff to collect and more. 

Also this set means I have the second most achievements and the most leaderboards in a game.  Tremble before Gundam!

[b]Is this just a progression set? Because it looks like a progression set[/b]

I'll be honest, Musou games SUCK for difficulty, it's really hard to balance a game where you have 40 different characters, plus you can level up, plus you can get different parts for the suits.  

But 382 missions have "Beat on hard with no interim save" Many are easy, Some are hard, some are brutal.  Enjoy.  

Also you have to do the friendship manipulation dance. 

Also Rank 4 parts require you to avoid two missions, so you have to earn them "Legit" 

[b]Wait Rank 4 parts are missable[/b]

Kind of.  Don't play Power of Bonds or The True Dynasty Warriors Gundam until after you're near mastery if you care (or play them on a seperate save file).  Those two unlock all Rank 4 parts.     "But that's easy"  Sure, but this is REAL gamer time.  Instead you have to earn the right to unlock the parts.  How do you do it?  Don't know!  Are they all possible? I'll be honest, don't know.  But you can find out!  I have seen a few lists of the information. 

None of these should be hard to do, but they will likely take a lot of time and require you to ACTUALLY play the game, in a way almost no one has.  Which is oh so good. 

[b]Wait, did you say friendship manipulation because the friendship system in this game is crap[/b] 

It really is. However I have a problem.  The Xbox 360 achievement list had it, and I'll be damned if I let the Xbox 360 be better than me, and so you're going to do everything that set requires....

[b]But you don't have... [/b] 

EVERYTHING That set requires (level 50 will be gotten somewhere, if you can somehow beat my set with out it... well that's impressive, or you just save scummed to artificially keep your levels low).  But seriously if 360 had something we didn't cover, I'd feel that our set is incomplete, and in a very small way their set is better.  So let's not let that happen. 

[b]Those badges[/b] 

598 badges.  Almost all are unique.  Enjoy it was like 3-4 days of mind numbing work. 

[b]I want to change something[/b]

Give me a good reason and I probably will. 

[b]I think an achievement is actually impossible.[/b]

They're not.  All hard mode achievements MUST be possible otherwise the game wouldn't work.  Friendship manipulation is possible, it just sucks.  The only question is the Rank 4 parts, but I'm pretty sure they're possible. 

[b]I want more "challenge" [/b]

Go play a different game.   Oh wait "challenge" you mean grind?  ... [game=26520]  Enjoy.  First subset.   

[b]But I don't want to have to ....[/b]

You have 5 save slots, when you get max level, max skill, max licenses. Grab a Interim save near the end of the mission.  Beat the game, save to a DIFFERENT SLOT.  Then load the interim save in subset.  Bam.   Core + Subset can't get here fast enough. 

[b]What's next?[/b]

I've done a Dynasty Warriors, a Samurai Warriors XL , a Warriors Orochi, and a Gundam 2.  I've fulfilled the covenant with myself.  I'm going to probably take a very long and hard rest and may never pick up the series as a dev again. 

Or Samurai Warrior 3, the only mainline game in the series I haven't played might also exist and I might have to do that for that roll out.  

Or maybe Devil King may be in my head right now and I'm just thinking about it.   Damn it.

Or Dynasty Tactics.
