[b]Why this game, as if we don't know? [/b]

It's INITIAL D!!!!!!   What [game=20775] wishes it was! ... Except you know, not as good. 

[b]Wait what was that? [/b]

Ok allow me to do a mini review.

Pro: Initial D license is so good.  Story mode is amazing.  THE LICENSED SUPER EUROBEAT WITH EVERY GREAT TRACK! This is perfection. 

Cons: The game kinda sucks.

[b]No that last thing what do you mean the game sucks? [/b]

Of course that's personal opinion, but Initial D games (at least this and Super Stage... and the Ps3 Extra stage... and more) are based on the Initial D arcade game. 

Now in an arcade, I'd throw down some quarters to pretend I'm Takumi and race against all my favorite Initial D Characters.  I wouldn't want to "Master Driving" I'd just put the pedal to the medal, jam out, and win some races.  

But we're not in an arcade, we don't have a full cabinet, and we're playing on a PS2.   The racing in this game is obscenely bad.  You basically can hold down the accelerator for the entire race, you'll use some breaking on sharp corners (mostly hairpins) and every car feels about the same power. 

Plus you can upgrade your cars a LOT... which is why I didn't put in any "Challenges". 

[b]So no Challenges?[/b]  

Well that depends, I let the game be the challenge.  Some opponents are damn hard.  Playing the game on Hard REALLY makes the game a bit brutal.  

Note: Difficulty only affects Arcade mode. 

Story mode is decently hard as well, and after about 5 races... I haven't had a lot of luck at the game.   And then S rank?  Holy !@#$ You're going to be challenged.  Above that though... yeah I didn't add any thing like "While only driving on two wheels beat X ..."  

Also I didn't do Time Trial challenges for two reasons.  A. I had no data to see what was the best, and B. Because you can upgrade your car until you're "full tuned" you'd basically either have stuff that requires full tune. Or you'd have stuff you can just level up to beat. 

But also refer to the above, the driving in this game is... Meh.  It's Initial D's Arcade game, it's not intended to be amazing, but If you want racing challenges, go choose one of my Tokyo Xtreme Drift achievements, especially Drift 2.  If you want a licensed Initial D game, enjoy yourself.
