[b]Why this game? [/b]

Literally it's number 28 on the site and un-deved, and I haven't deved a Mega Drive game. 

No seriously, that's the ONLY reason, this game is truly terrible, and while I enjoyed working on [game=5], this one is ... ehhh

[b]Ok, what makes it bad[/b]

It's a Mortal Kombat game but done as a platformer.  The game is pretty damn hard even in the best of time, but by the end of the game there's so many traps.  Oh and instant death pits which always can !@#$ right off.   Most secrets in the game are impossible to find even with a guide.  You can't fall through the ground to a lower level with out kicking, at least one of the gadgets (Holographic decoy) is impossible to trigger.  There's only like 6 non boss enemies in the entire game, and two or three bosses, which means there's only a little more than enemies then levels.  You have an awesome license and this is what you made? 

[b]What was that about secrets are impossible?  More than 5 points please.[/b]

If you can honestly prove you didn't use a guide ever to get the achievements, I'd give you 25.  But you can't, so just use this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDLaW-TDar0]video[/url].   

[b]What's up with the Holographic decoy? [/b]

No clue.  Equip it hammer the A button and then hold down and release it and hope it triggers, get the achievement and never use it again. 

[b]Any other controls? [/b]

Hit up and Rope to shoot the rope up... which honestly you never really swing with it, so that should have been default.   Enable the six button controller because while the three button works, the game is better with six buttons.  Or really don't play the game. 

[b]Wow you hate the game, so that's it? [/b]

Well first off [url=https://youtu.be/JFvtk5toGJg?t=323]AVGN's Coverage[/url] of the game was right.  (Note: adult language. like Testicles!)   I actually agree with everything he says, and I'm shocked at that.  The Genesis is a little better, but not much better. 

Also the game is bugged.  Yeah bugged.  Apparently some levels don't have all the collectibles in them.  Achievements all should work.  I did investigate if I could patch and fix the game.  Long story short, the Genesis memory tools are kind of weak, and I don't care enough about this game to fix it.  Maybe one day in the long future. 

Basically yeah,  Glad I deved the game, I gave it a great set, fans of the game will enjoy it I think, but I don't want to play it again.  

I can now check the Mega Drive off my list, and number 28 is done.
