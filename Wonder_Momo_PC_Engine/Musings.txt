Gonna be blunt, I'm already working on achievements for this game, basically kept it all in my head. 

"Beat a level"  12 of them
 
"Beat a level hitless" 12 of them

"Beat a level with out transforming" 12 of them

// Man I want to do this but I don't think there's a good indicator.  Sadly when in normal form, the flying enemies shoot weapons that cause the same "damage" 
"Beat the game with out getting a picture taken of your underwear"  Need a better name 1 of them.

"Beat the game with out needing a continue" 1 of them.

Score Achievements.  10k, 100k.  That's it. 

Leaderboard score.
Leaderboard time to beat the game. 
Rich presence something something. 

Honestly pretty simple game.  12 bosses.  Images will be the hardest, but I have a bunch of those already. 

Kind of a weak game.  Arcade game was better.  A Bit pervy too. 

Stage select is impossible to get into with out save states.  Ugh. 

But it doesn't do much.  Considering allowing it as kind of a "continue where you stopped"  Basically because you have infinite continues.
