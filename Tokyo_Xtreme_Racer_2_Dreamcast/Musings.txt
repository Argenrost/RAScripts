This would be a revision. 

This is just the message I wrote on Discord, it's nothing more than just a thought I have, but that's what Musings are supposed to be for me. 

(25, 50, 75, 100 percent of cars available to buy) , but I'd have to see.   Also have to double check if there's the 100 Quick race like TXR zero... (people hate that one. hehe)     (And heck add a couple fun achievements if I think of any)

Also the progession tags can be improved in my opinion. (it currently requires three playthroughs to "beat" the game, it should be one) 
I really like my max speed achievement in TXR3... it's a little tricky to get (you pretty much have to build a car to hit it)
Probably just enough achievements so people will complain about a revision, but the real fans would be able to knock out relatively fast.
