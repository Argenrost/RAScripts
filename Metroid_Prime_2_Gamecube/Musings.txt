Working on the European version, but will try to do US/European

First boss Dark Alpha Striker or what Every
No Damage at all in the room and No Missiles.   Basically "Perfect strafing/dodging"
Looks like everything is a pointer :(   


    Scan everything in Command Center on Agon Waste? 

    Scan everything in the ship halfway through the first area 

Bomb Guardian no damage, No Missiles.  Could be a little hard.

Dark Samus is going to be a beast, but should be reasonable for no missiles no damage

Jump Guardian is odd, but again No Missile No Damage?  Maybe.
