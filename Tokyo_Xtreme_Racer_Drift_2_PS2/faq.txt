[b]When?[/b]

Beginning of May.

[b]Why?[/b]

Because this series is a game where I blast the Super Eurobeat, drive my cars like crazy and feel like I'm in Initial D

And Drift is literally "Now you're in Initial D." 

[b]Is this the last TXR game you&#039;ll do?[/b]

Probably ... at least for now.   But I love the series so if there&#039;s a Console I haven&#039;t deved for I might grab another of this. 

Oh and Importer Tuner Challenge when ever that is available.

Also might do a revision on TXR2.  haven't decided.

[b]Anything to know?[/b]  

I'm hoping this will push people to the limit, we have beat the game (anyone can probably do that).  Not a scratch on me (hard but doable).  Make friends (Annoying but 25 should be reasonable, a subset will be created one day for every character to be friend, but I'm waiting for Core+Subset, sorry, I don't think it's a good idea to create a patch just for something that lame).

You will have to beat each sponsor challenge, some of these are very hard, but all should be possible. 

Then I have the challenges.  Record Challenge achievements have specific cars.  You MUST use a "Normal" car, so you can't tune it.   The Score is hard enough that I will never earn a single one of those.  Good luck.   

Then "Beat a full course with a full combo."  A Combo is given for 1000+ points in EACH corner.  Yes this is hard.  Yes it's supposed to be hard. 

Don't know about Record Tour, but because you can save after each course and save scum, you have to beat each class of Record Tour, then beat it with a perfect score.... then beat a race with out a Hit... Honestly probably not as hard as the rest of the game, but you tell me. 

Overall I wanted to push people beyond what I have asked in the previous games (outside of the 100 Quick Races) and I think I have. 

[b]Those Badges[/b] 

Yup, Had some fun with it.  If you know any other manga references let me know.  I know Wangan Midnight is supposed to be Unknown in the base game but that's not in this game. 

[b]I can use cheat codes in the user name.[/b]  

You can also run the same Gymkhana with a few sponsors for more than 2 million in under an hour, it doesn't matter enough to block it and every name gives people a variable amount of money.  "Link" allows me to buy a new Mazda 6... so why block Takumi and not Link?   There's another cheat for "extra licenses plates" to be honest, I couldn't be arsed to care about it.  The cheats in TXR 0 and TXR 3 are interesting at least.  This time, nah "cheat" all you want.  Cheat to get RP in Record Challenge... You don't gotta grind for that in my book.  

[b]X Race doesn't unlock.[/b]

[b]I can't figure out X  [/b]  

The information online for this game is spotty as fudge.  I feel like this series was at the end of it's steam sadly, and yet this is one of my favorite titles (TXR3 is better, but it's close).  I can tell you every advance and medal race CAN be unlocked, there is information out there, but it's.... yeah there's misinformation. 

Speaking of which, I looked at the "friend" code.  Didn't see anything that jumped out at me as to how to unlock it reliably.  Probably is random like everyone says.    The decision of if you made a friend or not IS made as you transition to the front end, but it's not reliable, like I said, probably random.
