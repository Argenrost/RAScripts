This is a repo of scripts I (Kinglink) Use to create achievements for Retroachievements(https://retroachievements.org) Please feel free to peruse them and check out my work.  

All work here has been done exclusively by Kinglink.  Achievements, concepts and ideas can be reused.  If permission is needed, please contact me (it will almost certainly be given.)  

If you want to improve or change my work on Retroachievements, contact me on Retroachievements, permission will almost certainly be given in some form.

I have no rights to any of the games listed here, and do not have permission to redistrubite the Roms, Executables, or ISOs.  

RATools which is used to read the scripts as information and download links at https://docs.retroachievements.org/RATools/
Some editing has been done by Krita(https://krita.org/en/).  However most files have been dumped directly from Ps2 Games (not included here as again I don't have the rights to the original textures).  Or screen shots taken from the games.  
I use Python for most of the scripts here.  I don't have requirements files. But will assist if someone needs help using them.  Use python 2 and attempt to import all listed libraries.
