Why this game? 

Because it's just awesome, just a man, a car, and a bunch of rivals to take down, repeat about 300 times, and you got an excellent game. 

What about the missable achievements?

The busy night can easily be done on the first night, of the game. Unless you ignore it for the entire game you should be able to grab it at some point.

Unique Night is impossible until you beat Unhappy Angel, but can be done almost any day after that. Just don't go return to garage until you earn it.

This game is hard.

Yup, there's certain cars that do far better than others.  A few bosses are just insane, and by the late game it's more about driving than just overpowering enemies.  I'll give you one big tip. The CE9A seems to be the best starting car, but honestly choose what you want, there's a LOT of trial and error here, and the game will unlock more and more of the shop as you go.

Why not a "No loss" achievement for the whole game? 

Because losses can feel random. Yes a great player will know when to start almost any race, but man, one mistake and that run would be over, and we're talking probably 8 hours.  If people REALLY want that, I'd consider it for a subset, but I'd put some rules on it. Such as you need to beat more than 10 new rivals before getting any achievement, so people don't savescum.   Yeah it'd be insanely hard.   

Also Quick Race exists if you want a real challenge.

Quick race is insane. 

50 points though.  I'm sure it's possible, but definitely not something I could do.  Good luck

Time attack is hard too.  

Time attack was dialed in using almost infinite money and end game cars.  It's not impossible, and it's done with me doing luke warm laps.  Heck there's a few already on the leaderboard faster than it.  But don't attempt it until you're in the second half of the game. 

What about TXR3?  

Already in progress 

So pump up the Super Eurobeat and let's get racing.
