God I love the missions in this game, why is this like the only one that had this.

Should I allow the extras? Like easier 5th weapons?   I like purchases 

Features and thoughts 
Do I have to record names of each level. .  Ugh.  There's a lot. 


Need to investigate the New Players  But won't do anything for those modes, it's a bit complicated all over the place. 

1000 on Chaos is already done for Keiji Maeda

Needs
