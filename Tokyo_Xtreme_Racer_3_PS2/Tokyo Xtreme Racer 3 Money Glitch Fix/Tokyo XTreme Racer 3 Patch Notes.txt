Hello! 

My name is Kinglink and this is my patch for Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3.  

Patch File: Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3 (USA).iso
CRC-32: a0b96c06
MD5: 054c01f5ca1a069a339b8c127b848ff0

When this patch is applied, Exotic Butterfly and Whirlwind Fanfare's requirements will be approximetly 100 times lower (200k for Exotic Butterfly, 1 million for Whirlwind Fanfare)  Other than that, this game should work exactly the same as the original.  Save files for both versions will work the same as well. 

20 years later and the game is now finally completable for the US version!  This version will be able to be used with Retroachievment's Achievement Set as well. 

Unlimited amounts of thanks goes out to Souzooka and Searo for opening my eyes to the fact I could create patches.

Have a great day.
