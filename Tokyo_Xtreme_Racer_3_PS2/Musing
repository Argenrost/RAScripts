Desire is low today, but let's do an achievement list. 

Every Team Leader.  Every Boss.  Every Wanderer.  Yeah why not 

Extra points for the harder than usual Wanderers

IDeas

- Win a battle in less than 20 seconds
Probably not great since it's a bit random, maybe end game? 

- Win a battle without losing SP
No... MAybe... I don't know.   But 95 percent is more likely. 

- Win a battle with less than 5% of SP left
Yeah. 

- Win a battle that lasted for more than 3 minutes
Sounds good. 

- Win a 5 km long battle
Ehh kind of matched with the above? 

- Win a battle on a really worn out car *
STruggling to get these values so far, but I'll try again. 

- Refuse a challenge by any non-boss rival
- Challenge a rival that doesn't want to race you
Interesting idea. 

Txr3 also features pit areas that could act as a collectible for exploration achievements
YEah this sounds good. 

400 kmh 
Hmmm 

"15-win streak" 
20.  20 gives you 2x.  That's the max

Change weather. 

Buy the best upgrades? 

Most wins in a row Leaderboard?  Yeah...
