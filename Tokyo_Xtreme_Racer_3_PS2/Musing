No... MAybe... I don't know.   But 95 percent is more likely. 

>- Win a battle with less than 5% of SP left
Yeah. 

>- Win a battle that lasted for more than 2 minutes  (3 minutes?) 
Sounds good. 

- Win a battle on a really worn out car *
STruggling to get these values so far, but I'll try again. 

- Refuse a challenge by any non-boss rival
- Challenge a rival that doesn't want to race you
Interesting idea. I haven't been challenged often though

YEah this sounds good. 
Except There's a Wanderer for that.

Unreachable. 

>"15-win streak" 
20.  20 gives you 2x.  That's the max
Actually 10 15 then 20.

All cards don't have "Best" upgrades I think, so would be annoying.
