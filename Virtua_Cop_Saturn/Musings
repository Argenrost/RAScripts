Icon already made, no need to make a new one. 

3 levels? That's it? 

Combo system is interesting but breaks the score a bit. 

A LOT of options, they all probably need lock outs.  I need to figure out what "Default" should be.   Will do anything Under default. 

Note sure if Gun Looseness is a "cheat" though

There are cheat codes for this game. 

GAme can be beaten multiple ways, which means the final bosses may not appear.  Achievement for that? 

Accuracy achievements?

Beat each scene?  Beat each stage? 

Beat game on Easy...  Maybe ignore all Options, but lock achievments.

You can combo people (keep them aloft) 

Don't shoot any innocent? (don't loose a life?) 

1 life 1 credit?

Stage 2 has 3 scenes.

Secret ending. 

Extra time on the name entry screen?
