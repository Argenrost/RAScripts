[b]Why this game? [/b]

It's parodius, a silly Shoot 'em up.  That's good enough for me!   Also Devjam. 

[b]What did you do special? [/b]

A. This has a special stage with three unique bosses, Each one is covered both at "any level" and "Hard"

B. I added "Sparing" achievements, where you let bosses fly away on Hard Difficulty.   Added a "Kill" achievement as well but the assumption is that will be easier. 

C. !? achievements where you damage a perfect ship. 

[b]Your sparing achievements are impossible.[/b]

I've been able to "Execute" all but two of the sparing achievements on hard.  However I didn't really try enough to say it's impossible.   Most of them are damn hard though. 

If no one is able to Master the game and it's the Sparing achievements that is a sticking point I might weaken the ones that haven't been bested in a few months, but I believe someone will figure out a way.   However I do believe they're all possible, just incredibly hard.   There's a reason I threw a few 25 pointers in there.     Or I'll do a more exhaustive search of every ship because I have a few theories on how it might still work.

[b]What's up with the difficulty in this game? [/b]

Yeah I know, the first two levels are pretty easy no matter the difficulty, but trust me when I say hard is WAY harder especially a few bosses. You'll definitely notice the difficulty if you try to tackle the sparing achievements. 

[b]The point totals are jacked.  10 for Normal 1cc and 10 for Hard 1cc [/b]

Nah, it's 25 points for hard, but you get 5 of those points for any difficulty, 15 of them if you beat it on normal, and the full 25 on Hard.  The point total there is intentional. 

[b]Anything else you want to say? [/b]

Every achievement is missable with the exception of the progression/Win Condition, upgrades, and Score.   I didn't mark it because it's 90 percent missable and that doesn't really make it great... then again many of them are able to be gotten on loop 2.

I didn't do a "Clear Loop 2" but 1 million points is going to be pretty hard to get.
