Some comments I made on Discord. 
200 Missions, 44 characters or so, 60 Suits.  Suits have Gear, Characters have Skills to unlock.  Oh and then you have mission mode for every character + officials, plus tons more.  And a friendship system that can be brutal.
AKA a fuck ton of stuff

200 Missions, You have A Character + A gundam, then a license for that character to ride the gundam.  Every character Skills, every gundam has parts you have to farm, every Character has friendships with every other character, Every character has a mission arc.  4 characters have a "Official" mission along with their mission arc.  I'm sure I'm missing a ton .


So Skills
Licenses
Story mode 
Original mode
Collect the side modes in Original mode together. 
One character perfect friendship (Xbox 360 achievement, so should do) 
Parts for each of the 60 suits.
Unlocking characters

Maybe beat a level in a ball and beat a level in a Zaku (not levels designed for them)

Beat char with a zaku?
