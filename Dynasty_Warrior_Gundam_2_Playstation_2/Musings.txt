Some comments I made on Discord. 
200 Missions, 44 characters or so, 60 Suits.  Suits have Gear, Characters have Skills to unlock.  Oh and then you have mission mode for every character + officials, plus tons more.  And a friendship system that can be brutal.
AKA a fuck ton of stuff

200 Missions, You have A Character + A gundam, then a license for that character to ride the gundam.  Every character Skills, every gundam has parts you have to farm, every Character has friendships with every other character, Every character has a mission arc.  4 characters have a "Official" mission along with their mission arc.  I'm sure I'm missing a ton .


All Skills?
Licenses
Story mode 
Original mode
Collect the side modes in Mission mode together. 
One character perfect friendship (Xbox 360 achievement, so should do) 
Parts for each of the 60 suits.
Unlocking characters
MS Lab
BUilding Dom 
Combo? 


Maybe beat a level in a ball and beat a level in a Zaku (not levels designed for them)

Beat char with a zaku? 

Befriend specific people? 

unlock Characters
unlock mechs. 


This one is much harder than Previous games. 

Missions seem like every character CAN beat them, but will they? that might cause some problems. 



X Need to find skills. 

  Need to find a way to do "Hard" missions, probably mission by mission.  Ugh. 

  Need to see if I can look at every player of a specific missions at once, should be reasonable. 

  Need to see if I can grab all the friendships in one pull. 

  Need to piece out the pars of the suits. 

  Need to piece out the MS lab values. 

  Need to piece out building suits. 

  Need to find the combos.
