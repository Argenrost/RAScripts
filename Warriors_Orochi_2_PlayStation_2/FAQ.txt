Why Warriors Orochi 2? 

Because it's there.   Honestly, looked at 1, looked at 2, and went with what I thought was the more interesting choice. 

Why not "Challenges"?   

To be fair, I couldn't think of any that would be interesting/fun without allowing out leveling it.  Besides the Dream Mode already has team pairings that are far better than I could do.  And there's over 400 achievements already.  "Beat a level with X Y and Z" team up just doesn't compare. 

So where's the challenge? 

Trust me, chaos stages will bring the pain at least early on.  Dream Modes are more that challenging enough, this might be an easier warriors but not a simple one.  Oh and the 50 wins in Survival?  Good luck with that one.

No Missable?  

Correct.  Everything should be earnable if you start from scratch.  The only thing you can't earn a second time is the full Chaos Scenario achievements, but you'll earn that as you play. 

Two Players allowed? 

If it doesn't say "Single player" you can do it in two player, I didn't want to block people, but in almost every case it's not really a benefit here.   You have to use the same characters, and you already can switch characters to get health back so there's minimal benefit to two players.
