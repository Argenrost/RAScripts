Why this game? 

Because I love the Strike Series, and didn't realize how weak this game was.   If you want to play Nuclear Strike, you should play the Playstation version.  

If you want to play a game that would be a good game, if it didn't have the name "Strike" on it, well that's this.  It's a linear experience, and a few times there's slow missions that force you to go at their pace or do something annoying rather than just feel like an absolute god in an attack helicopter. 

So just beat the game? 

Pretty much, beat the game. Beat the game on the hardest difficulty, and beat it on the hardest difficulty with out dying.   Even then it's probably pretty easy. 

There are cheat codes in this game. 

And you won't be using them.  Or you can but you aren't getting credit for them. 

What if something goes wrong, can I beat the level a second time? 

Yup, Make sure you have no cheats active and replay the mission.   There's no powerups or level ups so it shouldn't matter which order you play (Though the game does unlock in order).

What about the alternate vehicles you can use?

Use them.  Do you want an achievement for each?  Because they're pretty much in the way so you'll almost certainly use them, but there's no real "Discovery" to find them.
