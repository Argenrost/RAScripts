[b]What even is this?[/b]   

You know how there's [game=20794]  Well what if you wanted to "100 percent" the game for real.  

You play this.  Grab the patch which SHOULD be at [url=https://github.com/RetroAchievements/RAPatches/blob/main/PS2/Subset/29786-DynastyWarriorsGundam2-MaxCharacters.zip]this address[/url]  Or if it's not up yet, It is available at [url=https://github.com/Kinglink/RAPatches/blob/gundam-2-subset/PS2/Subset/29786-DynastyWarriorsGundam2-MaxCharacters.zip ]this link[/url](at least it will be until I kill that branch in git) ask me for it on Discord. 

[b]What about Friendship[/b] 

What kind of sicko are you?   Ok two problems with friendships, even if you max them all, you can easily manipulate it which means it'd be awful for save sharing.   

Also it's not an interesting feature.  It's not a "Max" character, it's just mindless toil, and while so is all this set... well this has a point, that would be... don't do it to yourself.   Or get 10 people to promise they'll play it and I'll see if dev compliance will let me do it. 

[b]This is painful[/b]  

Then don't play it, this is literally designed for the people who want to "absolutely 100 percent complete this entire game".... I don't even want to do that. 

[b]I mastered this legit it [/b] 

If you ACTUALLY mastered this 100 percent legit, please get in touch, I want to know how long it took you, because I'm seriously honestly 100 percent curious about that.  I have a theory it could be at least 4000 hours but I have a feeling it's far far less (but at least 400 hours right?)

[b]Why not undub?[/b] 

I'm so lazy man!   

Nah seriously, wait for core + subset... or just play up to the point you earn the achievement interim save, and switch games for one game.  You can do one mission with the bad voices, right?
