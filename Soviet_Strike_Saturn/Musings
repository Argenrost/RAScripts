// Starting the musings in a bad place. 

// Struggling to find what flips missions from "In progresS" to "Completed"  

// Game seems mad interesting.  It'd be great. 

// But I need to make the set better than the PSX version and with out those bits, it'll be far worse.  

// I can imagine some interesting challenges, interesting idea such as do X before Y.  But with out the "Complete" bits.  It's not going to work. 

// Did notice that on the PSX version the REV 1 doesn't work properly, reaching out to Set Creator to see if there's any information on that.
